\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
Perform tests in the yard with the complete system, to test new code for points described in proposed approach:
- Create a profiler for the code to search for slow operations. Milestone: profiler gives insight into performance of different parts of the code and allows comparison between different versions of said code. This way we can determine which is optimal
- Find more efficient ways to perform the needed operations. Milestone: Increase overall code speed. Use profiler as quantification
- Isolate parts of the mathematical model and test accuracy. Milestone: Mathematical as well as experimental estimation for line-up accuracy meets 0.1 mm requirement
- Expand the fitting model to increase the workability of the complete system. Milestone: Successful and efficient recognition of ribbed cylinder allows for good pre-line-up of pipes
