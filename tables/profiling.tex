        \textbf{\ref{fig:oop_track} Joint recognition} & LUA software detects joint as it moves towards mainline. U-Frame moves with joint after (successful) detection. & Flat surface resembling the joint (back of the ILUC-ribs mockup) is quickly brought into frame and subsequently kept still.\\ \hline

        \textbf{\ref{fig:oop_ILUC_ring} ILUC ring recognition} & Joint and U-Frame move until ILUC ring is detected, after which partial line up takes place. & Next to the joint mockup, the side of the ILUC ring is brought into frame representing the ILUC-ring.\\ \hline

        \textbf{\ref{fig:oop_ILUC_ribs} ILUC ribs recognition} & The ILUC-ring moves into the joint during the aforementioned partial line-up, after which the ILUC-ribs are detected. The joint is moved over the ribs towards the mainline. & A joint mockup (a side of the ILUC-ring mockup) is still in frame. The ILUC ribs mockup is slowly moved into frame, revealing all its ribs. \\ \hline

        \textbf{\ref{fig:oop_final_line_up} Final line up}  & The mainline gets detected and the joint is lined up with & The joint mockup and a second flat surface (mainline mockup) are slowly moved together. \\ \hline
